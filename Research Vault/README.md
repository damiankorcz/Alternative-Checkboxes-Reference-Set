This repository serves as a central place for all the research relevant to creating the Reference Set CSS. It's intended to be used directly as an Obsidian Vault. Note that most of the Research work was done in October 2024 so some stats will be outdated. At the moment, there are no intention to keep this vault updated (besides [[08 Style Settings Toggle Review]] and [[09 @container Style Queries Toggle Review]]). It serves as a record for what information was used to create the Reference Set CSS.

All themes and snippets that include Alternative Checkboxes are pre-installed for ease of testing. The following Community plugins are also included:
- `Style Settings` - Required for some themes.
- `Code Editor Shortcuts` - Easier multiline editing.

Please refer to the License section at the root of the repository for more information about what license each Theme / CSS Snippet / Plugin are distributed under.

Ideally, each Alternative Checkbox implementation should be previewed with **only** the relevant Theme / CSS Snippet enabled to avoid styling issues. Remember to only use one CSS Snippet at a time when testing and to have none enabled when testing Theme implementations (unless required). For CSS Snippets, I'd advise to test those with the Default theme enabled unless stated otherwise.

For convenience, I've pinned `Change theme` in the Command Palette for a quicker way to change themes.
