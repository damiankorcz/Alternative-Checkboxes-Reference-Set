# Overall Summary
Assuming the Reference Set would use the same Syntax / Meaning combo as the Minimal theme, which was identified to align with the most popular set of Checkboxes across all themes:
- 13 of 45 Themes with Alternative Checkbox implementation would be impacted *IF* they decided to align their themes with the Reference Set (detailed breakdowns below).
- Of the impacted themes, 1 Theme is Officially Unmaintained and 2 Themes are Light / Dark variants of the same theme.
- Of the impacted themes, judging by download count as an indicator of theme's use, impact is relatively low with the exception to Spectrum (Officially Unmaintained), ITS Theme and Cyber Glow.
- The following Syntax and Meaning parings have no conflicts:
	- `- [!]` Important / Warning / Exclamation
	- `- [?]` Question
	- `- [*]` Star / Favourites
	- `- [S]` Savings / Amount / Piggy Bank / Money / Price
	- `- [k]` Key
